**+1. Good!  Question below for further consideration.**


How many principal parts does a regular Latin verb have?
A regular latin verb has four principal parts (first, second, third, and fourth). 

Which principal parts are finite verb forms? What person and number is used for these principal parts?
The first and third principal parts are finite verb forms. They are used in the first person singular form of “I”. 

The verb interficiō “to kill” is actually a compound of the verb faciō. (Compare the way English can create phrasal verbs: “do away with” someone does not mean the same thing as “do” something!) Compare the principal parts of faciō and interficiō. Which parts are identical to prefixing inter- to a form of facio? What changes in the other forms?

The first principal part of interficiō maintains the similar end of -ciō as in the first principal part of faciō but changes the preceding a to an i. Similarly, the second principal part interficĕre maintains the same end of -cĕre as the second principal part of facĕre but changes the preceding a to an i. The third principal part of interfēcī maintains the similar end of -fēcī as the second principal part of fēcī but just adds inter- to differentiate the definition. The fourth principal part of interfectus changes the a in factus to an e. 

Memorize the principal parts of the verbs in the vocabulary list for unit 1, then answer the following questions.
name two verbs belonging to the fourth conjugation. How regular are their principal parts?

The fourth past principal parts of visus (to see) and ventus (to come) share the regular ending of -us. ❓ *Are there any other similarities you could pick out?* These two verbs share the same number of syllables. Visus is somewhat irregular in comparison to other fourth principal part verbs as it does not share a t preceeding us (-tus). For example like interfectus, habitus, and captus. 

compare the principal parts of the verbs capiō “to seize” and facio “to do, make”. How are the changes in their principal parts similar?

The first principal part of capiō shares the same ending with faciō as -iō. The second principal part of capĕre shares the same ending with facĕre as -ĕre. The third principal part of cēpī shares the same vowels with fēcī. The fourth principal part of captus shares the same ending with factus as -tus.
