**+1 Good translation!  A couple of details to tidy up.**

Cum *Achīvī* decem annōs in Troia **fuissent**, *Epeus* mirae magnitūdinis equum ligneum **fēcit**. In eō **collēctī sunt** *Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus*. et in equō **scripsērunt*** “DANAI MINERVAE DONUM DEDERUNT, castraque **transtulērunt** Tenedo. Cum id *Troianī* **vidērunt**, *Priamus* equum in templum Minervae **duxit**. Cum *Cassandra* **diceret** equum **habere** hostes, fidēs eī non data est et equum pro templō **posuērunt**. *Achīvī* **exiērunt** et custodēs **occidērunt** et Troiam **sunt potitī**.

The phrase decem annōs is in the plural accusative case✅ to highlight the temporal conditions the following clause is set in. ❌ *Can you be more specific about what the accusative means with a time expression* The accusative (annos) indicates an extended period of time, meaning they had already been there for ten years before Epeus began making the Trojan horse. 
Fuissent is in the third person plural active pluperfect subjunctive.✅ Its mood is in the subjunctive to indicate the conditions of the following clause;❌ *What does subjunctive mean in clause like this one?* it is in the pluperfect active which demonstrates these conditions happening before the following clause. The subjunctive mood is distinct from using indicative in this case because it presents the extended time that has passed as a condition informing why they began the plan of the Trojan horse. 
Mirae magnitūdinis is in the genitive case, singular, feminine. It is used to describe the horse being made. 
Collecti sunt is in the plural masculine, perfect tense, passive voice, and indicative mood. 
Cum id in lines 4-5 is in indicative mood and the accusative case. Cum is used as a preposition in this phrase. ❌ It is talking about time, not circumstance. 
Ei in line 6 is in the nominative plural case referring to “they” the Trojans.❌ Ei is in the dative case refering to "her" as Cassandra; indicating trust was not given to her.  
Exierunt comes from the verb exeo. 
Translation: 
When the Acheans had been in Troy for ten years, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size. Menelaus, Ulysses, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelusm Acamad, Thomas, Machaon, Neoptolemus were collected in that. And in the horse they wrote “Danai gave a gift to Minerva” and carried the military camp over to Tenedo. When the Trojans saw this, Priamus led the horse to Minerva. Although Cassandra said that the horse held enemies, belief was not given to her and they put the horse under❌ the temple. New translation: they made the horse a temple/set it up as a temple. 
The Greeks killed the guards and Troy was acquired.
